        <h1>Project 1: Flying Objects</h1>
        
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        
        Through your work on this project, you will advance your ability to:
        
        <ul>
          <li>Work with code provided by others.</li>
          <li>Write basic graphics code in Java.</li>
          <li>Use design patterns to create robust object-oriented designs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>This semester, we'll aim to implement a game of sorts. That's pretty vague, intentionally: a lot of the details of the game will be up to you and your imagination (and how much time you have to implement your dreams). In this first project, you'll do a lot of work on the fundamentals; in project 2, you'll add more game behavior, including the ability for multiple people to play over the network. Probably this will not look much like <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. More like <em><a href="http://www.freeasteroids.org">Asteroids</a></em>. But this isn't a graphics class, is it?</p>

        <p>When you first download the "skeleton" project, run the program. You should see a black 'field' with a white triangle-ish thing on it. Not very exciting. The black represents SPACE. Whether it's <em>outer space</em>, or a parking lot, or what a dog sees when it dreams, is up to you. The white triangle represents a "spaceship," or really any kind of flying object. (Maybe it's really a spaceship; maybe it's a shopping cart in a parking lot; maybe it's a cat being dreamed by a dog.)</p>

        <p>Now look at the code. The "spaceship" is modeled by a <code>SimpleSpaceObject</code> object. It doesn't do much; it just sits there. (At this point, I strongly recommend you read the javadoc!)</p>

        <p>For now, imagine that essentially everything in your game is going to be a <code>SpaceObject</code> . Some <code>SpaceObjects</code> will be more interesting than others, though.</p>

        <h2>The Skeleton</h2>

        <p>Before we get too caught up in all those space objects, let's talk about the skeleton code. You don't have to understand it all now (though you will, by the end of the semester). The class that gives the basic game functionality is <code>Game</code>. This class gives you a <code>JPanel</code> that is repainted every 100th of a second, so it's a crude kind of animation (good enough for us). That is, the <code>paintComponent()</code> method WILL be called every 100th of a second, so if you want to create the appearance of motion, you need to move things between one invocation of <code>paintComponent()</code> and the next.</p>
        
        <p>I've extended <code>Game</code> to implement a <code>SimpleGame</code>: note that I provide a constructor <em>and</em> I override <code>paintComponent()</code>. The <code>paintComponent()</code> method asks the <code>ship</code> to <code>paint()</code> itself (because <code>SpaceObject</code> isn't a Swing component, I don't have to use a method called <code>paintComponent()</code>&mdash;really, I could call the method anything I like, but <code>paint()</code> is a very good choice).</p>
        
        <p>How is the <code>ship</code> actually painted? Follow the code and look at the <code>Polygon</code> class. As the documentation says, you don't need to worry much about the mathematics inside the <code>Polygon</code> class, but you should certainly understand how to use the <code>public</code> methods.
          
        <h3>Java graphics</h3>

        <p>Understanding the code requires understanding the basics of graphics in java. For this game (like almost any video game), you will be forced to think about the x-y coordinate plane (be glad this is a 2-D game, not a 3-D one!). You may be used to a coordinate system where the origin (0,0) is the bottom left, with positive numbers going up and to the right&mdash;or you may be familiar with a coordinate system where the origin is in the middle, with positive x to the right and positive y above. </p>
        
        <p>In Java, the world is a little different: the origin (0,0) is the <em>top left</em> corner, positive x goes to the right (as 'usual'), and positive y goes <em>down</em>. Angles in this system are also different than you might be used to: "0 degrees of rotation" points to the right along the positive x axis (as 'usual' in geometry/trigonometry), but increasing degrees of rotation go <em>clockwise</em>, so "90 degrees of rotation" is <em>down</em> the positive y axis, and "270 degrees of rotation" is <em>up</em> the negative y axis. Stop here and draw yourself a picture.</p>

        <h2>Adding Behavior: Design Patterns</h2>

       <p>In this project, you will use design patterns to create several different kinds of space objects. At minimum, you will create three additional classes: <code>FallingObject</code>, <code>SpinningObject</code>, and <code>ControlledObject</code>.</p>
       
       <p>To start, modify <code>SimpleGame</code> so that the ship, instead of just sitting on one place, 'falls' down the screen and eventually disappears at the bottom. Obviously, the big question here is <em>how</em> to modify the existing code.</p>
       
       <p>Once you've figured out how to do that, use the <strong>Decorator</strong> pattern to create a <code>FallingObject</code> class that "wraps" <code>SpaceObject</code>. (So the relationship between <code>FallingObject</code> and <code>SpaceObject</code> should be the same as the relationship between <code>BufferedReader</code> and <code>Reader</code>.) I've given you some infrastructure for this: note that you have an interface <code>SpaceObject</code> which is implemented by both <code>SimpleSpaceObject</code> and <code>SpaceObjectDecorator</code>. The <code>SpaceObjectDecorator</code> abstract class is the basis for any decorator we might want&mdash;look again at the wikipedia page on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">decorator pattern</a> to review the logic.
         
         <p>Similarly, create another <strong>Decorator</strong> called <code>SpinningObject</code>. This wrapper doesn't change an object's location but just makes it rotate in place. (Note that you can combine these decorators to create falling-and-spinning object, even though you didn't write a <code>FallingSpinningObject</code> class. This is one of the cool things about decorators.)</p>
         
         <p>As you're working on this, be thinking about what sort of game you want to implement. What sorts of objects will you need? What shapes might they have? (You don't need to spend a lot of time on creating beautiful shapes, but obviously different types of things should look different!)</p>
         
         <p>Finally, create a <code>ControlledObject</code> <strong>Decorator</strong>. This will correspond to the object in your game controlled by the user (specifically the user's keyboard). Think about what this object should do in response to user's control: should it move around 'space'? Should it rotate? Speed up? Slow down? Fire a bullet/laser/flower? Provide a method for each one of those behaviors, then use the <strong>Adapter</strong> pattern (as described in the book, pp 619-621; don't worry about using "anonymous inner classes") to "hook up" keyboard events to the <code>ControlledObject</code> methods. In particular, you will need to implement the <code>KeyListener</code> interface. Browse the Java API&mdash; which package is this in? What methods do you need to implement in order to correctly implement this interface? What object will be "generating" the events to listen for? What object should do the listening? (Hint: be sure you understand the differences among the methods of that interface. You must provide implementations of all of them, but you can leave implementations empty if that particular event isn't relevant to you.) In my experience, it's easier to work with the alphanumeric keys than with the arrow keys. </p>
         
         <p>If your game needs them, create more <strong>Decorator</strong>s for other kinds of object behavior. (You are <em>required</em> to create the three <strong>Decorator</strong> classes listed above, even if you don't use all of them in your game.)
           
           
           
           <h2>Game Logic</h2>
           
           <p>Once your game-space is populated with objects, implement some game logic&mdash;that is, there should be a little bit more to your game than objects that fall, spin, and move around. Something should happen. Perhaps the most straightforward thing to deal with is the collision of two objects&mdash;this could mean that a ship collided with an asteroid, or that Pac-Man ate something, or a ball bounced off a tree. Consider using the <code>contains()</code> method as a collision detector. You may need to adjust the <code>SpaceObject.collide()</code> method.</p>
           
           
           
           <p>When is the <strong>Game Over</strong>?</p>
           
           <p>You might also want to change the name of the <code>SimpleGame</code> class to reflect the name of your game...</p>
         
         
         <h2>Other Design Issues</h2>
       
       As you're working, keep your eyes open for ways to improve the design of your code. (Don't worry about changing <code>Polygon</code> code&mdash;if you need to add or change its behavior, you probably don't need to change its code.) For example, in <code>SimpleGame</code>, the shape of the ship is provided by the <code>SimpleGame</code> class. Is that the best place for information about the <em>ship</em> to live?
       
       
        <h2>Doing More</h2>

        <p>You've now done everything you need to do to earn 100% on this project. Yes, there is lots more that could be done! For up to 10 points of extra credit (plus your personal satisfaction), you might want to:</p>

        <ul>
           <li>Provide logic for adding new objects in the middle of the game, either to replace things that have been destroyed, or to make the game more difficult.
           
           <li>Alter the logic of the "edges" of space&mdash;you could have things 'wrap' so that if they fall off the bottom they reappear at the top, or they could bounce off the edges, or...
           
            <li>Give your user multiple 'lives' and keep track of them.</li>

            <li>Display a running score.</li>

            <li>Anything else you can dream of!</li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>

        <h2>Submission and Grading</h2>

        <p>This project is due at 6pm on Class 17. At that time, I will clone your GitHub repository. No subsequent changes to your repository will be graded.</p>

        <p></p>

        <p>I will communicate with you about your project through GitHub&mdash;at minimum, I will add comments to your code and push the results back to you.</p>

        <p>I will grade out of 100 points, allocated among the following categories:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>
                <p><b>Documentation</b>. Your project should include revised documentation in the doc folder. For classes/methods that you don't change, you don't need to change the documentation. Obviously, add documentation for classes you create. For methods/classes that <em>change</em>, <em>delete</em> my doccomments and replace them with your own. Yours must all begin with the word <code>CHANGED</code> so that I can locate them easily. Use Eclipse's "Generate Javadocs..." function to generate the new documentation.<p> 
                  
                  <p>Also, revise the README.md file. It should have three main sections. First, "Description and Instructions." Briefly describe the game and its objective(s), and tell me how to play it. Next, "Works Cited." I expect you will need to consult a variety of resources to complete this project. Any website, book, or similar resource from which you get useful guidance must be listed here, along with a brief description of what you got from it (a bit of code? an explanation? an answer to a question?). You do not need to list the Java API or either of the two books required/recommended for class. If you use no other resources, then your "Works Cited" section must simply contain the word <em>None</em>. Finally, "Code Summary." In this section, just list your <em>new</em> classes and methods and your <em>changed</em> classes and methods.  to include a brief summary of the methods and classes you changed. If you do any work for extra credit, then add a section on "Extra Credit" that briefly lists the extra credit features you successfully implemented.
                           </li>

          <li><p><b>Design</b>. Are the relationships among your classes (and the way they interact with the Java library classes) logical, clear, and robust? Do they (for example) adhere to the IS-A and HAS-A rules? Do you use design patterns correctly and effectively? Is your code otherwise well-designed, e.g. avoiding duplicate code?</p></li>


            <li><p><b>Style</b>. Your code should be properly formatted, with enough (but not too much) whitespace. Eclipse will do most of this for you; make sure you let it help you. Variable names, method names, etc, should all be "self-documenting" but not excessively long. <em>Generally</em>, you can use any style you like, as long as you're consistent. If you're not sure what style to use, follow the <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html">Google Style Guide</a>, except where Eclipse's automatic formatting contradicts these guidelines.</p></li>

            <li><p><b>Correctness and Efficiency</b> . Does your game "play properly?" Does it offer at least the minimum set of behaviors described above? Does it do so efficiently, without wasting computation?</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>We will decide together, in class, how exactly to allocate the 100 points across these catgories.</p>

        <p>It's probably clear, but just to be explicit: on this project, you are to work strictly <em>on your own</em>. Specifically, you may neither show your code to, nor look at the code of, anyone else taking 3120 this semester. You may consult online/textbook resources (subject to the "Documentation" requirements above). You may certainly consult with me. You may, if you like, discuss your design at a high level with other students ("Oh, I found the <code>java.foo.bar</code> package to be really helpful," or, "Sure, I can explain the geometry of a paint window to you."). </p>
